			<h3>About me</h3>
			<div class="about-align">
				<div class="about-left">
					<p>Hello! I'm Harsh Yadav, a dedicated student currently pursuing my studies at UPES, Dehradun. My passion lies in the world of technology, and I am aspiring to become a skilled software engineer. As a curious individual, I am constantly exploring the vast realms of the digital landscape to enhance my understanding and skills.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						My academic journey has been a rollercoaster of experiences that have shaped my resilience and determination. I started as a bright student until the disruptions caused by the pandemic led me to take a drop year for JEE mains. During that period, a combination of external challenges and my own lack of focus affected my performance.
	
					This setback became a catalyst for self-reflection, leading me to reevaluate my goals and priorities. Although I faced challenges and couldn't achieve the rank I aimed for in JEE mains, it became a turning point. It prompted me to take a step back and reconsider my interests and aspirations.
					</p>	
				<p>	
					Now, with a renewed sense of purpose, I am starting afresh. I am dedicating myself to exploring various fields, seeking to discover my true passions. The journey from a period of uncertainty to rebuilding and rediscovery has fueled my commitment to continuous learning and personal growth.
	
					I am embracing the opportunity to explore new avenues, build skills, and redefine my path. Despite the challenges, I am optimistic about the future and excited to share my evolving journey through this portfolio. Join me as I navigate this transformative phase and work towards unleashing my full potential.
	
					Let's connect, learn, and grow together!
